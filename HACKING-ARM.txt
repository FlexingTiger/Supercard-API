With these instructions, you'll be able to set up your development environment to compile ARM executables (.nds plugins) for general flashcarts, as well as the NDS-Supercard communication layer on the Supercard DSTwo.

If all you want to do is compile MIPS executables (.plg plugins) for the Supercard DSTwo, you don't need this file.

-- Setting up the devkitPro Nintendo DS toolchain --

1. Set up devkitPro at /opt/devkitpro as outlined in the following page:

   http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started/devkitARM [validated with r45]

   After creating the directory, use the following commands to make the directory owned by your user's group so that you can write into it as a regular user:

 $ sudo chown root:$(whoami) /opt/devkitpro
 $ sudo chmod 775 /opt/devkitpro

2. Make sure to download and install all the devkitPro libraries for the Nintendo DS, all extracted into /opt/devkitpro/libnds:

 $ mkdir -p /opt/devkitpro/libnds
 $ cd /opt/devkitpro/libnds

 - libnds
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/libnds/ [validated with 1.5.9]

 - libfat-nds
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/libfat/ [validated with 1.0.13]
   (Note: Make sure to get the libfat release for nds, not the others)

 - dswifi
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/dswifi/ [validated with 0.3.16]

 - maxmod-nds
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/maxmod/ [validated with 1.0.9]
   (Note: Make sure to get the maxmod release for nds, not the others)

 - filesystem
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/filesystem/ [validated with 0.9.11]

 - Default ARM7, to handle WiFi, audio and touchscreen input
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/default_arm7/ [validated with 0.6.0]

3. Make sure the environment variables DEVKITPRO and DEVKITARM exist in your shell's initialisation file (such as $HOME/.bashrc):

 $ export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
 $ export DEVKITARM=$DEVKITPRO/devkitARM

-- Rebuilding the ARM side --

After changes to the source code under arm-side/arm9/ or arm-side/arm7/, run this command in the arm-side directory:

  $ make clean; make install

The final product of the build, arm-side.elf, will be copied to $SCDS2_TOOLS/tools/ds2_firmware.dat.
